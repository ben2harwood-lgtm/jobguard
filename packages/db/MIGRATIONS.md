# Database migration strategy

`0000_tenancy.sql` is the M0-4 fresh-install baseline. It is intentionally
idempotent so an existing M0-1 database (which had no application tables) can be
upgraded safely. Tests execute it both fresh and a second time.

The migration creates roles but does not create production login credentials.
Deployment must grant the non-login `jobguard_runtime` role to a separately
managed application login. The migration owner remains separate from runtime.

This foundation migration is forward-fixed rather than rolled back: dropping
RLS, tenant columns, schemas, or roles could expose or destroy tenant data. A
failed transaction leaves the previous state intact; corrections ship as a new,
reviewed migration.

RLS is a defence within a correctly verified tenant context. It does not protect
against a compromised owner/migration connection or an application bridge that
is allowed to manufacture a false verified context.

`0002_evidence.sql` is the forward-only M0-11 evidence-storage migration. It adds
RLS-protected upload, immutable object-registration, and authorized-link tables.
An interrupted migration rolls back transactionally; corrections are forward fixes
because removing evidence identity or object-version references would weaken proof.
Object bytes remain private and versioned outside PostgreSQL. Object Lock/WORM is
intentionally not enabled pending the retention/deletion decision.
